Bug triaging and issue curation
================================

The `issue tracker <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues>`_
is important to the communication in the project: it helps
developers identify major projects to work on, as well as to discuss
priorities. For this reason, it is important to curate it, adding labels
to issues and closing issues that are not necessary.

Working on issues to make them better
--------------------------------------

Improving issues increases their chances of being successfully resolved.
Guidelines on submitting good issues can be found :ref:`here
<filing_bugs>`. A third party can give useful feedback or even add
comments on the issue, while core-developpers or members of the triage
team can edit the issue description and title.

The following actions are typically useful:

  - documenting issues that are missing elements to reproduce the problem
    such as code samples

  - correcting incorrect use of code formatting

  - making sure that the title and description are explicit about the
    problem to be solved

  - linking to related issues or discussions

.. topic:: Fruitful discussions

   Online discussions may be harder than it seems at first glance.
   Overall, it is useful to stay positive and assume good will. `The
   following article
   <http://gael-varoquaux.info/programming/technical-discussions-are-hard-a-few-tips.html>`_
   explores how to lead online discussions in the context of open source.

Guidelines for issue organizing and triaging
----------------------------------------------

Members of the core team and the triage team can in addition do the
following important tasks:

- Update labels for issues and PRs

- Follow up on stalled PRs, to see if they must be relabeled as
  stalled and needing help (this is typically very important in the context
  of sprints, where the risk is to create many unfinished PRs)

- Triage issues:

  - close the issue and point the reporter to use Stack Overflow instead
    when it's clearly a usage question.

  - closing duplicate issues, but only after checking that they are
    indeed duplicate. Ideally, the original submitter moves the
    discussion to the older, duplicate issue

  - when uncertain on whether an issue should be closed or not, it is
    best to strive for consensus with the original poster, and possibly
    to seek relevant expertise. However, when the issue is a usage
    question, or when it has been considered as unclear for many years it
    should be closed.

:ref:`Saved replies <saved_replies>` are useful to gain time when
triaging.
